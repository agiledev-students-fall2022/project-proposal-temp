## <center>How?</center>

Given a location and a range, the app will display all locations where NYU free food is being offered within that range and the time at which that offering began. Users can also create "offers" of free food and post them for other users to see and update their post depending on how much food is left.

- The authenticity of a post by setting a lowest number on how many students have to post "free food is here" within a certain distance range.
- The validity of an account by banning phishers who get reported by other accounts 

The app will not be too ambitious either since:
