# Where Da Food at?

**Jiaming Li, Mark Lung**


## <center> What and why? </center>

Our software idea is inspired by NYU free food facebook page. Instead of constantly checking your phone to find out where is your next free meal handed out by some random generous NYU club, now you can open our app and post/see info about the newest free food around you on the map, and take more advantages of NYU clubs. 

## <center> For whom?</center>

This web app will be designed for all NYU students who are interested in getting free food, or for people who want see where free food is located near their location.

## <center>How?</center>

Given a location and a range, the app will display all locations where NYU free food is being offered within that range and the time at which that offering began. Users can also create "offers" of free food and the estimated amount of people the food will feed and post them for other users to see. These posts can be updatd depending on how much food is left. Submissions are automatically removed after a certain time period.

## <center>Scope</center>

The app will not be too easy since we have at least several things to check:
- The user's identity as a NYU student (email or netID).
- The area from which the user will locate the free food.
- The time at which the post was created as well as query from the databse to update how their posts.


The app will not be too ambitious either since:
- The app is only facing NYU stduents and the map range would be ratherly small.
- The app doesn't need a huge database or a cloud storage since the posts are not permanent and will be removed from the memory usually within hours.
