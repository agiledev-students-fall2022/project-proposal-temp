## Project Title

## What and why?

Our software idea is inspired by NYU free food facebook page. Instead of constantly checking your phone to find out the where is your next free meal handed out by some random generous NYU club, now you can open our app and post/see posts about newest free food around you on the map, and take more advantages of NYU clubs. 

## For whom?

This web app will be designed for all NYU students who are interested in getting free food

## How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

## Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.
